# The code's pretty good y'know, only moderately below par

## Quick Overview
- This is a [titanfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanfall_2)-themed bot I started making for my friend, it's semi complete
- If you look at my first attempt at a discord bot and then this one, you'll notice the code I wrote here is **much** more structured
- Quick list of improvements: commands have aliases, prefix is case insensitive, a brand spankin new help command, puppet mode (as per a special request), a tad of memory management, a bit of optimization, oh and the token isn't hardcoded in anymore

### Building
1. Run CMake
2. Configure and generate for visual studio
3. Open the solution file
4. Set the bot as the start up project
5. Compile and hope (or don't) that it works
6. Enter a bot token when prompted
