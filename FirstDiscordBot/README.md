##Aight so here's the rundown
- This is a discord bot that just sends stupid messages for the sake of sending stupid messages
- It is my first project in C++ and the code's very messy/sloppy/mistakable for ramen
- Oh and I changed some stuff before uploading without testing so who knows if it works now

(p.s. this project uses [SleepyDiscord](https://github.com/YourWaifu/sleepy-discord "stellar discord c++ library"))

###Building (not sure why you'd want to though)
1. Run CMake
2. Configure and generate for visual studio
3. Open the solution file
4. Change the TOKEN variable in LeOkayHandBot.cpp to an actual token
5. Set the bot as the start up project
6. Compile and hope (or don't) that it works


*~~come to think of it I probably should leave this off github~~*
